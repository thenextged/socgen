# Meeting Summary

In this meeting:
- I proposed the SoC design methodology:
    - horizontal layers (M layers)
        - abstract SoC (functions, topology, etc.)
        - function/IP refinement
        - clocks and reset
        - interrupt management
        - interconnect synthesis
        - interface legalization
        - power control
        - debug
        - DFT
        - Front-End physical design
    - vertical domains (N domains)
        - hardware construction
        - software design
        - design verification
        - simulation/emulation
        - Design space exploration
        - Documentation
- Mark and I agreed that the NxM complexity of the SoC design methodology is too much for the
thesis. We chose to focus on the software design domain/vertical
- We came up with the following questions:
    - what do we want to capture in each layer that is relevant to software?
    - how do we capture that information ?
    - how does the sequence language come into this?
- Next step:
    - we want to think and come up with examples that we need to show that this methodology works:
        - select a few IPs (DMA, IRQ Controller, Clock and Reset, Interconnect, CPU, Memory)
        - each IPs come with its own RegSeq sequences
        - what abstractions do we use in the sequences at:
            - IP level? (example, DMA sequences referencing IRQ actions)
            - System Level?
            - Application-level (example: app calling `WaitForIRQ()`)
    - Research at least 2 policies per layer and show:
        - how top-level software reasons about the policies
        - how policies and sequences play together
        - how hierarchical elaboration from policies > regseq sequences > final software is done


Note:
-----

To show an example of a scenario:
- DMA engine has interrupt capability (# of IRQs, how to enable, how to mask, how to service, etc.)
- IRQ controller manages interrupts (enabling, masking, servicing, IRQ ISRs, etc.)
- IRQ controllers can be chained
- Application has a concept of interrupts (`WaitForIRQ`)
- DMA sequences have a concept of IRQ (`EnableIRQ(...)`, etc.)

Let's show how this all comes together
