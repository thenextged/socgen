# PSS Modeling Concepts

- An `activity` primarily specifies the set of actions to be executed and the scheduling relationship between them.
- Actions may be scheduled:
    - sequentially
    - in parallel
    - various combinations based on :
        - conditional evaluation
        - looping
        - randomization
- Activities may also include `explicit` data bindings between actions
